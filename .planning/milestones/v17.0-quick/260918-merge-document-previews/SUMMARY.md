# Quick Task Summary: Visual Document Previews for Document Merge

## Quick ID: `260918-merge-document-previews`

- **Date**: 2026-09-18
- **Objective**: Display real visual PDF document previews (page 1 thumbnails) instead of plain text document names and arrows (`Doc 1 → Doc 2`) in the merge modal.

---

## What Was Done

1. **Modal Layout Expansion & Visual Preview Cards Container (`index.html`)**:
   - Expanded `#merge-docs-modal` container from `max-w-md` to `max-w-lg` to comfortably accommodate side-by-side thumbnail previews while maintaining responsive design.
   - Enhanced `#merge-order-banner` in `#merge-step-save` with a visual preview container:
     - Section title: `معاينة المستندات المدمجة • Merged Document Sequence`
     - `#merge-preview-cards`: Container for visual preview cards with order badges (`#1 (البداية)`, `#2 (النهاية)`), page count badges, thumbnails, and title info.
     - Preserved `#btn-merge-swap-order` (`⇄ تبديل • Swap`) in banner header.
     - Added an inline circular swap button between Card 1 and Card 2 for intuitive tap/click swapping.
     - Preserved `#merge-order-summary` (hidden element) for full backwards compatibility with screen readers and existing assertions.

2. **Asynchronous PDF Thumbnail Rendering & In-Memory Caching (`doc-manager.js`)**:
   - Implemented `renderDocThumbnail(containerEl, doc, width, height)`:
     - Resolves the document PDF stream URL using `resolveMergeDocPdfUrl(doc)` (integrating `getResolvedArea` and `getResolvedHouse`).
     - Uses `pdfjsLib.getDocument({ url })` to render Page 1 onto an HTML `<canvas>`.
     - Caches rendered data URLs and canvas objects in `mergeThumbnailCache` and deduplicates concurrent renders via `mergeThumbnailPromises`.
     - Clicking `⇄ Swap` now swaps preview cards in 0ms with zero network reload or flicker.
     - Provides clean SVG document placeholder fallback in non-browser / headless / test environments without errors.
   - Updated `updateMergeOrderSummary()` to dynamically populate `#merge-preview-cards` with cards and sequence connectors.
   - Updated `renderMergeDocsList()` to include mini thumbnails (`.merge-thumbnail-mini`) in each reorder row.
   - Updated `closeMergeModal()` to reset the cache and DOM cleanly when the modal closes.

3. **Automated Testing & Verification**:
   - Updated `tests/web/components/merge_documents.test.js`:
     - Added `#merge-preview-cards` to `setupDOM()`.
     - Added assertions verifying preview cards render with order badges, page counts, titles, and thumbnails.
     - Added assertions verifying inline swap button swaps cards and document sequence.
     - Added assertions verifying mini thumbnails in reorder rows for >2 documents.
   - Fixed `tests/web/components/doc_viewer.test.js` property setter for `pdfFrame.contentWindow` via `Object.defineProperty`.
   - Verified 100% test pass rate across the full test bed: **42 of 42 test files passed, 596 of 596 tests passed**.
   - Synchronized updated assets to `dist/win-x64/wwwroot/` and restarted web server.
